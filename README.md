# Neural Network-based Reinforcement Learning Agents
A project realized in a team of 2, where we implemented different neural network-based reinforcement learning agents: a REINFORCE agent, an Actor-Critic agent, an expected SARSA agent and a Deep Q-learning agent. We then tested the agents'performance on the ACROBOT gym environment and the ale_py Assault-Ram environment and conducted multiple experiments in order to compare the agents to each other and understand the impact that their hyperparameters can have on an agent's performance compared to another one.

EDIT: The Jupyter notebook is a bit large, and thus unfortunately cannot be viewed directly on GitHub, but you are free to download it if you would like.
